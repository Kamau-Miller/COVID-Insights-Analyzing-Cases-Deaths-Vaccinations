# SQL-Explporation-Guided-Project
This project was conducted as part of collaboration with Alex the Analyst on SQL exploration. The aim was to analyze and compare COVID Deaths and COVID Vaccinations using data sets sourced from CDC.GOV. The primary focus was on specific columns: Location, Date, Total Cases, New Cases, Total Deaths, and Population.
Data Sets
The project utilizes two main datasets sourced from CDC.GOV:
•	COVID Deaths
•	COVID Vaccinations
SQL Queries and Analysis
Queries Explored
The SQL exploration involved several key queries and analyses, including:
•	Comparison of Old vs New Cases: Analyzed the changes between old and new cases over time.
•	Total Cases vs Total Deaths: Investigated the correlation between total cases and total deaths.
•	Total Cases vs Population: Explored the relationship between total cases and population.
•	Countries with Highest Infection Rates: Identified and compared countries with the highest infection rates.
•	Countries with Highest Death Rates: Identified and compared countries with the highest death rates.
•	Total Vaccinations vs Global Population: Analyzed the relationship between total vaccinations and the global population.
Additional View Creation
A view was created to facilitate future data visualization and analysis.
Usage
The SQL scripts used for these analyses are provided within the repository. Users can replicate the queries and explore the dataset further.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
•	/Queries: Contains SQL scripts used for the analyses.
•	/Data: Houses the datasets used in the project.
How to Use
1.	Clone the repository.
2.	Utilize your preferred SQL environment to run and analyze the provided scripts.
3.	Ensure the necessary datasets are available in your working environment.
